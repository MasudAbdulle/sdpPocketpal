Welcome to PocketPal, a powerful budgeting web application that takes Time Value of Money (TVM) into account to help you create and manage your budgets effectively. PocketPal offers various budgeting options, including "50/30/20 Envelope," "Custom Budget," and "Zero-Based Budget." Please note that the current version of the application is designed to run on your local machine.

Features
Time Value of Money (TVM): PocketPal incorporates the Time Value of Money principle to consider the impact of inflation on budgeting decisions. This ensures that the budgets you create maintain their purchasing power over time.

50/30/20 Envelope Budget: This budgeting option follows the popular 50/30/20 rule, where 50% of income is allocated to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt payments. PocketPal helps you allocate your funds accordingly.

Custom Budget: You have the flexibility to create a custom budget tailored to your specific financial needs and goals. Allocate different percentages or fixed amounts to various expense categories.

Zero-Based Budget: PocketPal supports the concept of zero-based budgeting, where every dollar of income is allocated to different expense categories or savings, leaving no funds unallocated.
